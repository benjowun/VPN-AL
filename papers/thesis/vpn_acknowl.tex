\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my coadvisor at TU Graz, Dipl.-Ing. Andrea Pferscher, whose patience, advice and draft corrections made this thesis possible. 

I would also like to thank Ao.Univ.-Prof. Dipl-Ing. Dr. Bernhard K.~Aichernig for his support of my choice in topic and his invaluable feedback.

Last but not least, a special thanks goes to the most important person in my life, Alex, my better half, whose constant motivation and food helped keep me sane during long days of debugging.
