\begin{abstract}
Virtual Private Network (VPN) protocols are widely used to create a secure mode of communication between several parties over an insecure channel. A common use-case for VPNs is to secure access to company networks. Therefore errors in VPN software are often severe. IPsec is a VPN protocol that uses the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE). IKE has two versions, IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2. While several papers have investigated IPsec-IKEv2 in the context of Automata learning, no such work has been performed for IPsec-IKEv1. In this short paper we describe the IPsec-IKEv1 protocol and show the steps taken to learn the state-machine of an IPsec server. Finally we present our learned model and discuss its potential applications.

\section{Introduction}
% background
VPNs are used to allow secure communication over an insecure channel. The importance of VPN software has increased dramatically since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the influx of people working from home \cite{abhijith2020impact}. This makes finding vulnerabilities in VPN software more critical than ever. IPsec is a VPN protocol and most commonly uses the IKE protocol to share authenticated keying material between involved parties. Therefore, IKE and IPsec are sometimes used interchangeably. We will stick to the official nomenclature of using IPsec for the full protocol and IKE for the key exchange only. IKE has two versions, IKEv1 IKEv2, with IKEv2 being the newer and recommended version \cite{nist791491}. However, despite IKEv2 supposedly replacing its predecessor, IKEv1 is still in widespread use today. This is reflected by the company AVM to this day only offering IKEv1 support for their popular Fritzbox routers \cite{avm2022}.

%Problem
State models of protocol implementations are useful tools in testing. They can for example be used to compare versions and to generate test cases automatically TODO: REFERENCES!. One method of generating these models is to use Automata Learning. TODO: MORE ON AUTOMATA LEARNING 1-2 SENTENCES! Several papers have investigated IPsec-IKEv2 using Automata Learning, however so far none have looked at IKEv1. 

% My solution
We show the process of learning a state model from an example IPsec-IKEv1 server. We use the Active Automata Learning framework AALpy for model learning with a custom python interface between AALpy and the IPsec server.

% Structure of Thesis
In this short paper we first go over preliminary information on VPNs and Automata Learning. Then we present the used Active Automata Learning framework TODO: MAYBE ADD THIS TO PRELIMINARIES AS WELL! and discuss related works. In chapter 4 we present our custom interface between AALpy and the IPsec server and discuss design choices as well as implementation difficulties. Finally we present the learned model and discuss its potential applications and further work.

\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{abhijith2020impact}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.

\subsubsection{Acknowledgements} Please place your acknowledgments at
the end of the paper, preceded by an unnumbered run-in heading (i.e.
3rd-level heading).
